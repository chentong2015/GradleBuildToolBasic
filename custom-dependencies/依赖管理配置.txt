Dependency Declaration Configurations

TODO. implementation 同时被源码和测试代码在两个阶段所使用
Represents dependencies that are required both at compile time and runtime
for the main source set of a project (i.e., implementation only dependencies).

TODO. compileOnly
Represents dependencies that are required only at compile time and are not included in the runtime classpath
(i.e., compile time only dependencies, not used at runtime).

TODO. runtimeOnly
Represents dependencies that are required only at runtime and are not included in the compile classpath
(i.e., dependencies required only at runtime).

TODO. testImplementation extends implementation
Represents dependencies that are required both at compile time and runtime for the test source set of a project
(i.e., implementation only dependencies for tests).

TODO. testCompileOnly
Represents dependencies that are required only at compile time for the test source set of a project
and are not included in the runtime classpath
(i.e., additional dependencies only for compiling tests, not used at runtime).

TODO. testRuntimeOnly extends runtimeOnly
Represents dependencies that are required only at runtime for the test source set of a project
(i.e., runtime only dependencies for running tests).

TODO. annotationProcessor
Represents annotation processors used during the compilation of a project’s source code
(i.e., annotation processors used during compilation).
