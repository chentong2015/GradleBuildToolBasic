插件会简化Java应用程序的开发和打包
Java Application plugin facilitates creating an executable JVM application
- Easy to start application locally during development
- Easy to package the application as a TAR and/or ZIP

TODO. 插件会添加多种可执行的Tasks
Application:
- run: standard JavaExec task
Distribution:
- assembleDist
- distZip
- distTar
- installDist: Creates a full ZIP archive including runtime libraries and OS specific scripts.
Other:
- startScripts: Creates OS specific scripts to run the project as a JVM application.

TODO. 通过Task直接启动应用
> ./gradlew run
> ./gradlew run --debug-jvm        启动Debug模式
> ./gradlew run --args="foo --bar" 传递命令行参数

Applying Application plugin also implicitly applies Java plugin.
