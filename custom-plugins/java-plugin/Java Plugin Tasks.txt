Java plugin adds a number of tasks to your project:

TODO. compileJava — JavaCompile
Depends on: All tasks which contribute to the compilation classpath,
including jar tasks from projects that are on the classpath via project dependencies
Compiles production Java source files using the JDK compiler.

TODO. processResources — ProcessResources
Copies production resources into the production resources directory.

TODO. classes
Depends on: compileJava, processResources
This is an aggregate task that just depends on other tasks.
Other plugins may attach additional compilation tasks to it.

TODO. compileTestJava — JavaCompile
Depends on: classes, and all tasks that contribute to the test compilation classpath
Compiles test Java source files using the JDK compiler.

TODO. processTestResources — Copy
Copies test resources into the test resources directory.

TODO. testClasses
Depends on: compileTestJava, processTestResources
This is an aggregate task that just depends on other tasks.
Other plugins may attach additional test compilation tasks to it.

TODO. jar — Jar
Depends on: classes
Assembles the production JAR file, based on the classes and resources attached to the main source set.
